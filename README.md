Processing task for UTS

## INSTRUCTIONS:
Pressing ‘i’ shows a debug menu that provides key inputs to control certain weather elements. 

The strings at the top of the page open up to show a list of commands for the specified object listed at the top of the list.

You can change the cursor at the top of the screen to alternate between feeding mode and cursor mode.

Cursor mode allows you to interact with the birds.

Feeding mode disables cursor mode and drops food at the cursor location on the field. Food is NOT spawned at the top where the UI elements are.

Feeding the birds will increase their size and lower their pitch.

Click on the birds to make them chirp.

Make a loud noise to make them fly.

Use the “volume limit” setting to increase the amount of noise required if in a loud place.
